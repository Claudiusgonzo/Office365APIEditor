2. Create an application registration

3. Go to https://\<tenantName\>.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/AppInv.aspx and assign permissions


Sample XML
```xml
<AppPermissionRequests AllowAppOnlyPolicy="true">
<AppPermissionRequest Scope="http://sharepoint/content/tenant" Right="Read"/>
</AppPermissionRequests>
```

```xml
<AppPermissionRequests AllowAppOnlyPolicy="true">
<AppPermissionRequest Scope="http://sharepoint/content/sitecollection" Right="Read"/>
</AppPermissionRequests>
```
